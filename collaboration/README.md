<!-- group norms list -->
Discussions:
We as a group will try first of all to maintain a healthy and safe work environment.
We as a group will be open to an unexpected direction and strive to learn.
Debate:
We as a group will try to define the scope and objective of our debate clearly.
We as a group will try to debate positions/terms/ideas/concepts/themes but in NO WAY people.
We as a group will try our best to take turns during the debates to debate both sides of the debate.
Our intention during the debate should always be POSITIVE!
Being open to accepting changes/new concepts, ideas, and diverse opinions.
When nobody is willing to compromise, then we will turn to a group VOTING.
When two people are debating, we can consider having a negotiator between them.
Timing:
We as a group will have a good intention when it comes to respecting each other’s time. We will try to be on time, however, if we can’t make it on time, let's inform the group beforehand. In exceptional cases, when there is an urgency and we are in a position not even to inform, our intention is what matters.
We cannot be present at some meetings/activities, but what matters the most is our presence in the group in general. We will try our best to be active when having time and contribute to the best of our abilities.
We will all make sure to recognize the role of external factors, which are often out of our control. In such a situation, what matters the most is to let our group members know that we are here to support them and that they can count on us.
Deadlines are important, but communication matters the most. There is always space for communication.
As a group, we will arrange a meeting 48 hours ahead and set the agenda of the meeting and when setting a time, the majority availability should be taken into consideration—for example (a WhatsApp poll).
Before working on a task we should set a SPECIFIC TIME for that TASK!

Trust:
Trust is a default, and throughout our journey, we will build this trust.
We as a group will build a trustful relationship. One way to build trust would be to participate in a small experiment, which will allow us to make personal connections. On New Year's Eve/or whenever we have time, we will write a very small paragraph about us and share it in the WhatsApp group with each other (maybe backing it up with a picture if we want). Submit everything on time.
In our group, there is no space for DISRESPECT, INDIFFERENCE, and BETRAYAL!
We as a group should feel confident/free to ask questions and as a group, we should try to answer each other’s questions.
Accept our responsibilities, work hard to get it done, and if challenges are faced, we should communicate them to the group.
Distilling:
Discussions: Keep the work environment safe and supportive. Be open to learning and new ideas.
Debates: Focus on ideas, not people, with clear goals. Stay positive and take turns sharing different views. Use group voting if no agreement is reached. Have a mediator for one-on-one debates if needed.
Timing: Respect everyone’s time; let the group know if you’re late or can’t join. Contribute when you can, even if you miss some meetings. Deadlines are important, but communication comes first. Schedule meetings 48 hours in advance with a clear agenda. Set specific timeframes for tasks.
Trust: Trust each other from the start and build it over time. Share personal stories to strengthen connections. No tolerance for disrespect or betrayal. Ask questions freely and help each other solve problems. Take responsibility for your tasks and communicate any issues.
Refining:
We will maintain a supportive and safe environment where all members feel valued and heard.
We will stay open to learning and adapting by embracing new ideas, perspectives, and changes.
We will approach debates with positivity and respect by focusing on ideas, not individuals, and aiming for productive outcomes.
We will communicate openly and clearly to address challenges, share updates, and foster understanding within the group.
We will respect each other’s time and commitments by being mindful of punctuality, deadlines, and external circumstances.
We will build and maintain trust by being reliable, honest, and supportive in all interactions.
We will take responsibility for our contributions and support each other in overcoming challenges.
We will make decisions collaboratively by valuing diverse opinions and using group consensus or voting when needed.
We will foster connections within the group to strengthen our relationships and create a positive team dynamic.
We will adapt our norms as needed to reflect the group’s evolving needs and priorities.
